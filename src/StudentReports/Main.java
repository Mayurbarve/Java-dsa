Problem Statement
Design a StudentReportCard class that stores a student's information and grades securely using encapsulation.

Requirements:
The class should have the following private fields:

name (String) - student's name
rollNumber (int) - student's roll number
mathScore (double) - marks in Math (0-100)
scienceScore (double) - marks in Science (0-100)
englishScore (double) - marks in English (0-100)
Provide a constructor that takes name and rollNumber.

Provide public getters for all fields.

Provide public setters for the three scores with validation:

Score must be between 0 and 100 (inclusive).
If an invalid score is passed, print an error message and do NOT update the score.
Write a public method getPercentage() that returns the average of the three scores.

Write a public method getGrade() that returns:

"A" if percentage >= 80
"B" if percentage >= 60
"C" if percentage >= 40
"F" if percentage < 40
Write a public method printReportCard() that prints all details in this format:

=== Report Card ===
Name: Rahul
Roll Number: 101
Math: 85.0
Science: 72.0
English: 90.0
Percentage: 82.33%
Grade: A
===================

 */

public class Main {
    void main() {
        StudentReportCard std = new StudentReportCard("Rahul", 101, 85.0, 72.0, 90.0);

        std.printReportCard();

    }

}
