    /*
Problem Statement
Design a simple Employee payroll system using inheritance, constructor chaining with super, method overriding, and method overloading.

Requirements:
Create a base class Employee with:

private fields: name (String), id (int), baseSalary (double)
A constructor that takes all 3 fields
A method calculatePay() that returns the baseSalary
A method displayInfo() that prints name, id, and calculated pay
Create a subclass FullTimeEmployee extends Employee with:

An extra field: bonus (double)
A constructor that takes name, id, baseSalary, and bonus (use super() to call parent constructor)
Override calculatePay() to return baseSalary + bonus
Create a subclass PartTimeEmployee extends Employee with:

Extra fields: hoursWorked (int), hourlyRate (double)
A constructor that takes name, id, hoursWorked, and hourlyRate (pass 0 as baseSalary to super)
Override calculatePay() to return hoursWorked * hourlyRate
In FullTimeEmployee, overload displayInfo():

displayInfo() — no args, prints everything including bonus
displayInfo(boolean showBonus) — if false, hides the bonus line
In a Main class:

Create one FullTimeEmployee and one PartTimeEmployee
Store both in an Employee[] array
Loop through the array and call displayInfo() — observe polymorphism!

 */

    void main() {

        FullTimeEmployee fullTime =
                new FullTimeEmployee("Mayur", 101, 50000, 10000);

        PartTimeEmployee partTime =
                new PartTimeEmployee("Rahul", 102, 80, 500);

        // Polymorphism
        Employee[] employees = {fullTime, partTime};

        for (Employee emp : employees) {
            emp.displayInfo();
        }

        System.out.println("Method Overloading Demo");
        fullTime.displayInfo(true);

        System.out.println("Without Bonus");
        fullTime.displayInfo(false);
    }
}
